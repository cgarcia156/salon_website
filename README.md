# GG's Salon Website

This is a website built with React that serves as an online presence for a beauty salon. The website allows users to learn more about the salon's services, contact the salon, and learn more about the salon's team.

The website consists of the following pages:

- Home: An overview of the salon and its services
- About Us: Information about the salon and its team members
- Contact: A form for users to get in touch with the salon
- Services: A list of the services offered by the salon

The website uses the `react-router-dom` library to handle routing between the different pages.

This website is hosted on Firebase and uses Firebase as a database to collect contact messages submitted through the contact form.
